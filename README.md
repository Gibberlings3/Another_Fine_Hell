# Another fine Hell
Another more ingame reason for the PC's fall at the end of SoD!

This mod introduces a new reason why the PC falls at the end of SoD and has to leave town. For this, events after the slayer-dream-sequence are altered accordingly. The mod does not introduce a new catastrophy or frame work, it just uses what is already happening at Dragonspear basement and gives said events a new focus in people's perception of the PC's power and possible posed threat in combination with their divine heritage.
The mod uses as many original lines and situations as possible. Also, the event that leads to the fall in the original game is still in and still plays an important role for the PC to regain the favor of the Dukes of Baldur's Gate. It just isn't the reason the PC has to leave the town any more. 
For EET, install the mod directly to your EET game.

Please note: this mod is in alpha and does *not* include any BGII content yet. SoD part is finished.

In a later version, there will be the possibility to finish a quest given by the Dukes of Baldur's Gate to regain redemption - and to help the Sword Coast to get rid of a constant threat from the nine hells.
